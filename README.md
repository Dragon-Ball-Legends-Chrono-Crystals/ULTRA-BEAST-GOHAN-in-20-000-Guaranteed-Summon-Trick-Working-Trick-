### Why ULTRA BEAST GOHAN Is a Must-Have  
Ultra Beast Gohan is undeniably one of the strongest units in Dragon Ball Legends.

### The 20,000 Guaranteed Summon Trick Explained  
Here’s the step-by-step breakdown to increase your odds of pulling Ultra Beast Gohan. Many players have tested and confirmed this method to work like a charm:

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Required Chrono Crystals**  
Before you start, ensure you have at least **20,000 Chrono Crystals** in your account. While it may sound like a lot, this method guarantees your pull, making every Crystal worth it.

#### **Step 2: Use Daily Discount Summons Strategically**  
Instead of going all-in at once, start with your **daily discount summons**. This helps the system register consistent activity from your account, which can subtly improve your RNG (random number generator) pool.

#### **Step 3: Multi-Summon at Specific Times**  
Timing matters! According to players, summoning during specific server reset times (e.g., 11:00 AM UTC or 2:00 PM UTC) increases your odds. Most banners have higher pull rates within the first 15 minutes after a reset, so keep an eye on those windows.

#### **Step 4: Alternate Between Summon Banners**  
Instead of sticking to just one banner, alternate between **Step-Up Summons** and other active banners. This trick has reportedly reset the RNG pattern, giving you better odds when you return to the main Ultra Beast Gohan banner.

#### **Step 5: Pay Attention to Animations**  
Summon animations like *Super Saiyan Blue Goku, Broly Cutscene, or Bardock Assist* are strong indicators of a featured character. If you see these animations, you’re on the right track—your Ultra Beast Gohan might just be around the corner.
